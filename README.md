## Introduction

tvbland is a TV show app that allows users to browse the latest added TV shows in the UK and look up individual show details including a rating, cast list and weekly schedule.

Built in Next.js, tvbland makes use of the inbuilt API capability and implements a graphQL wrapper built on a graphql-yoga server for a REST API. This is a SPA that combines SSR and CSR.
